## Contributions
### What to work on
See our [list of outstanding issues](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/TQVaultAE/issues). It contains simple bugs, not so simple bugs and feature requests.

#### Note on unsolicited contributions
What if you want to work on something not in the list? No problem, we welcome any contribution to the project! With that said, please keep in mind that the community might suggest changes or refrain from accepting an unsolicited contribution if it strays too far from the goals of this project.

### Pull requests
Submit your pull request to the master branch of the [main fork](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/TQVaultAE).
