# How to use TQVaultAE with Titan Quest 2006

Titan Quest original from 2006 (TQ) is still available out there [via Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4540/discussions/) (when you buy it before the Anniversary Edition era) or via CD installation.

TQ include an anti-cheat system that prevent external tool to edit character save file.
If you do, vanilla TQ will at best undo your modifications, but more probably will make your character unplayable.

A smart guy, [SoulSeekkor](https://tq.soulseekkor.com/), created a tool that can disable that anti-cheat when you play.\
So TQVault can be used with TQ but you need TQDefiler to use TQVault while you play your character.

TQDefiler can be download at
- [soulseekkor.com](https://tq.soulseekkor.com/downloads.html)
- [moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/games/titan-quest/downloads/soulseekkor-tqit-defiler)
