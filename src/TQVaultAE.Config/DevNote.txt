Developers note

- Remember to report any configuration design changes to the configuration file of EXE (TQVaultAE.GUI)

hguy - 2022-08-15 :
Old user.config settings are in sub directories of "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\titanquest.net_community".
It was a pain for users and the source of too many misunderstanding during support, so i move all userSettings 
into UserConfig.xml which is deployed with the executable.
From now on, it's the dedicated file for all user level configuration.

It is programmatically used in an exact similar way as the standard .NET class except we control the path.

Examples:
TQVaultAE.Config.UserSettings.Default.Scale = 1;
TQVaultAE.Config.UserSettings.Default.Save();
