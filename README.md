## Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.
**Q. Can TQVaultAE use my old vault files?**

*A. Yes, TQVaultAE is compatible with the legacy TQvault vault files.*

**Q. Does TQVaultAE modify my items? The stats I see are not the same as the ones ingame.**

*A. No, unless you specifically use the cheats, TQVaultAE doesn't alter items in any way. 
The difference you see is simply due to the way stats are generated in Titan Quest: each item has base stats and a unique seed that modifies those stats. 
TQVaultAE only displays the base stats (and not the modifications due to the RNG).*

**Q. Can I use TQVaultAE while playing the game?**

*A. No, using TQVaultAE while running the game may lead to loss of progress or items. Best practice is to close the game before using TQVaultAE.*

**Q. After updating from an older version of TQVault (2.18 or older), the new program won't start.**

*A. Follow these steps (See [this comment](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/TQVaultAE/issues/85#issuecomment-447326792) for the original solution):*
1. *Press the `Windows` key*
2. *Type `cmd`*
3. *Right-click the first option and run as administrator*
4. *Type `regsvr32 /u VXPLib.dll`*
5. *Hit enter*

**Q. Error Loading Resources. This may be caused by a bad language or game path setting.**

*A. Follow these steps:*
1. *Navigate the the installation folder of TQVaultAE*
2. *Open `TQVaultAE.exe.config` in a text editor (i.e. notepad, **not Microsoft Word**)*
3. *Replace the following sections:*
```xml
<setting name="AutoDetectGamePath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>True</value>
</setting>
...
<setting name="TQITPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value />
</setting>
<setting name="TQPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value />
</setting>
```
*by (replace the path to the correct one for your computer)*
```xml
<setting name="AutoDetectGamePath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>False</value>
</setting>
...
<setting name="TQITPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>C:\examplePath\Titan Quest Anniversary Edition</value>
</setting>
<setting name="TQPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>C:\examplePath\Titan Quest Anniversary Edition</value>
</setting>
```
4. *Open TQVaultAE*

7. *Click OK to close the configuration menu*

**Q. I have this game as a stand-alone (i.e. not through Steam or GOG). How can I make TQVaultAE work?**
