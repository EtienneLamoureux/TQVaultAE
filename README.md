### Configuration
The "Configure" button (top-left) opens up the configuration menu. That's where you can change:
- The language used by the application
- The paths where the vault files are located
- The paths where the game files are located
- The cheats (To enable/disable these options, see the F.A.Q. below)

## Troubleshooting and F.A.Q.
**Q. Does TQVaultAE modify my items? The stats I see are not the same as the ones ingame.**

*A. No, unless you specifically use the cheats, TQVaultAE doesn't alter items in any way. The difference you see is simply due to the way stats are generated in Titan Quest: each item has base stats and a unique seed that modifies those stats. TQVaultAE only displays the base stats (and not the modifications due to the RNG).*

**Q. Can I use TQVaultAE while playing the game?**

*A. Only when using the "Allow hot reload features" setting, otherwise it is not safe to do so. Even then, be aware that any unsaved changes made in TQVaultAE will be lost when interacting with in-game inventories.*

**Q. What happened to my items, I transferred items to my character and they are not there in game?**

*A. If you are using the Steam version of the game, make sure Steam Cloud synchronization is disabled as it will overwrite local game saves modified by TQVaultAE with cloud older saves.*

**Q. How to enable/disable the cheats (character edition, item edition, item copy)?**

*A. Follow these steps:*
1. *Navigate the the installation folder of TQVaultAE*
2. *Open `TQVaultAE.exe.config` in a text editor (i.e. notepad, **not Microsoft Word**)*
3. *Find the key `AllowCheats` and change the value to `True` or `False`*
    - *`True` will allow you to toggle the cheats individually in the configuration menu*
    - *`False` will disable the cheats completely and make it impossible to enable them in the configuration menu*

**Q. Can TQVaultAE use my old vault files?**

*A. Yes, TQVaultAE is compatible with the legacy TQvault vault files.*

**Q. Error Loading Resources. This may be caused by a bad language or game path setting.**

*A. Follow these steps:*
1. *Navigate the the installation folder of TQVaultAE*
2. *Open `TQVaultAE.exe.config` in a text editor (i.e. notepad, **not Microsoft Word**)*
3. *Replace the following sections:*

```xml
<setting name="AutoDetectGamePath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>True</value>
</setting>
...
<setting name="TQITPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value />
</setting>
<setting name="TQPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value />
</setting>
```

*by (replace the path to the correct one for your computer)*

```xml
<setting name="AutoDetectGamePath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>False</value>
</setting>
...
<setting name="TQITPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>C:\examplePath\Titan Quest Anniversary Edition</value>
</setting>
<setting name="TQPath" serializeAs="String">
    <value>C:\examplePath\Titan Quest Anniversary Edition</value>
</setting>
```

4. *Open TQVaultAE*
    - *You might be greeted with a warning dialog about the vault path not being set. Click OK.*
5. *Open the configuration menu by clicking the top-left button*
6. *Validate the vault path and the game paths shown*
7. *Click OK to close the configuration menu*

**Q. I have this game as a stand-alone (i.e. not through Steam or GOG). How can I make TQVaultAE work?**

*A. See the answer to "**Error Loading Resources. This may be caused by a bad language or game path setting.**" above*

**Q. Does TQVaultAE work with the Immortal Throne expansion?**

*A. Yes*

**Q. Does TQVaultAE work with the Ragnarok expansion?**

*A. Yes*

**Q. Does TQVaultAE work with the Atlantis expansion?**

*A. Yes*

**Q. Does TQVaultAE work with the Eternal Embers expansion?**

*A. Yes*

**Q. Can I still earn achievements while using TQVaultAE?**

*A. Yes*

**Q. I have a problem not listed here. What can I do?**

*A. There are several things you can do:*
- *Close TQVaultAE and open it up again. It may fix your problem*
- *Look up if your problem is featured in [our previously answered questions](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/TQVaultAE/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion+)*
